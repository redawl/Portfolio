In it, we learned about systems of differential equations, where you have one differential equation for the change in x coordinates and a different equation for the change in y coordinates. Using these two equations, we were able to create beautiful vector fields.</p>' +

My professor suggested we use <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/m/utcMvuUy">this</a> generator, by Pablo Rodriguez Sanchez. At first glance, this applet appears to have no issues. But on closer inspection, if you want to understand the behavior of the field farther away from the origin, you have to guess by the direction of the specific solution arrow. Also even if you stay closer to the origin, the vectors do not have directional arrows, only lines that show the slope, which in some cases is not enough information, and you end up having to rely on the specific solution arrow again. Clearly, there was room to improve. So I got right on it.</p>' +
                    '<p>I first started out using Unity, scripting in C#, since I was familiar with the tool. I started by writing a <a href="https://github.com/redawl/Unity-Scripts/blob/master/Vector%20Field%20Generator/CameraZoom.cs">camera handler script</a>, which allowed the user to pan around the viewport, and to zoom in and out. Then I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/redawl/Unity-Scripts/blob/master/Vector%20Field%20Generator/GenerateGrid.cs">script</a> to generate the graph, as well as the axes of the graph. Finally, I got to work on the <a href="https://github.com/redawl/Unity-Scripts/blob/master/Vector%20Field%20Generator/VectorFieldGen.cs">script</a> that generates the vector field. I used the awesome custom library <a href="http://mathparser.org/">mxParser</a> by Marius Z Gromada to parse the differential equations from the strings given to me from unity input fields.

To accomplish this, I want to move away from Unity and create the rest of this project using OpenGL. While it has a much steeper learning curve, I will be able to fine-tune its implementation to do exactly what I need it to do, and nothing more. With Unity, I would be stuck with a lot more functionality than I would need or use. The current build of this OpenGL project can be found <a href="https://github.com/redawl/VectorOpenGL">here</a>.
